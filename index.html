            <p>竹子用了4年，仅仅长了3cm，从第五年开始，以每天30cm的速度疯狂的生长，仅仅用了六周就长到了15米。</p>
<p>读到这句话的时候，我想到了自己。2011年入职公司至今，同一家公司，同一个办公室，五年的积累，我是否能像竹子一样？<br>我希望答案是：Yes!</p>
<p>2016年，我要疯狂生长：  </p>
<p>1、通过OneNote，梳理五年来积累的知识点，形成知识库，涵盖网络、系统、存储、安全方面；  </p>
<p>2、冲刺英语整体水平，在2016年底完成英语课程；  </p>
<p>3、2016年上半年考取驾照；  </p>
<p>4、2016年6月中旬，完成Linux课程学习；  </p>
<p>5、2016年12月份中旬，完成Python课程学习；  </p>
<p>6、2017年初，我希望自己这样：<br>在技术上有深度，也有广度；<br>能够流畅用英语沟通，无大障碍阅读英文书籍；<br>性格上，不骄不躁，中庸。</p>
